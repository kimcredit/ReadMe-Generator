# Readme Generator

# Description
A CLI application that generates a github readme based on user input. 

## Usage
When the user has the application downloaded, they will run the index.js file through their command line. 
They will then be prompted to provide information about their project, including a title, description, installation instrucitons, usage information, licenses, contributions instructions, tests, and their email and github username. 

The application then takes all of their provided information and generates a clean, organized readme including all information they provided as well as a functioning table of contents, a badge for their selected license, and a link to their github page.
